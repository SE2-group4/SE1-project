# Post Mortem

Consider the EZGas project and provide your thoughts after completing it. 
Distinguish between what you could not change (requirements, tools, timing, team selection, etc) 
and what was under your control (team organization, available skills, communication tools, etc).
Also this document will not be used for evaluations, but for improving the project approach for the coming year.


## Best things
The initial idea of developing an application from start to bottom and seeing all the phases of the project was really good.
The team organization of the work went smoothly since we all worked really hard on the project without needing a push from one of our teammates. 

We arranged that each one of us had some specific work to do (in equal part) and we all put a lot of effort in doing our part. 
If one of us had some issues in the implementation the other's helped until the issue was resolved (this applied for everyone).
We always pushed each other to finish the work as soon as possible, delivering a quality job. We double checked our work before each delivery to the professors to ensure that the requests were satisfied.

Collaboration between us was really good, we always notified each other of changes made and we organized almost every week at least 2/3 meeting to work things together. We didn't have any issues working together even if we never saw each other in person, that was good.

## Worst things
The things that didn't work out for us were:
- Spring Boot framework wasn't an easy concept to get without any introduction on it since the dependency between classes weren't clear. 
- Lack of communication with the professors regarding the assignments. Doing thing blind is not fun.
- It was difficult to understand how some parts of the interface and the code behind it worked. Sometimes we had to do some digging in the front end classes to find how to do some operations to test our code.
- Having the explanation of the delivery been done while the delivery was already in progress wasn't easy since we firstly had less time to implement changes, and secondly because sometimes we already had made some changes and we had to undo them to comply with the assignment.
- Making the teams almost one month after the beginning of the lessons caused a ripple effect in the deliveries dates causing them to finish in the middle of the exam session creating not so many problems

## Suggestions 
Suggestions for the next years could be:
- To change the APIs sooner if problems in the code are found right away by the students
- Answer on slack more frequently since the lessons are usually not targeted to answer project related questions and we frequently need some confirmations to avoid making changes a 1000 times.
- Explain in depth the various phases of the project at the beginning of the course to avoid surprises at the end.
- Manage delivery dates better so that the project is finished a week before the end of the lessons so that in the exam session students can focus only on the actual exam.
